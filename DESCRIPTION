Description: 
  Statistical power analysis tools for designing cluster randomized trials (CRTs).
  Includes functions to calculate minimum detectable effect size (MDES),
  minimum required sample size (MRSS), power (1 - type II error),
  functions to estimate optimal sample sizes (OSS) under various constraints,
  and to visualize duo or trio relationships between MDES, MRSS, power, and OSS.
